            <h3>BASc Honours | Sustainable Energy Engineering</h3>
            <h4>International Studies Minor | Environmental & Economic Development</h4>
            <p>Hello! My name is Tianna, and I am an undergraduate student at Simon Fraser University pursuing a major in Sustainable Energy Engineering, with a minor in International Studies focused on environmental and economic development. My journey into engineering began with a passion for international studies, as I was keen on understanding the intricate connections between environmental issues and economic development. However, I soon realized that I wanted to go beyond studying the problems and delve into finding sustainable solutions. This realization led me to switch my major to Sustainable Energy Engineering, where I could merge my interests in both international studies and sustainable technologies.</p>
            <p>Growing up I have always been interested in space exploration, but throughout my academic journey, I have cultivated a love for the environment as well. I am fascinated by the endless possibilities within our universe, as well as the pressing need to protect and preserve our planet. It is my firm belief that the future of engineering lies in finding innovative ways to bridge these two worlds together.</p>
            <p>Within this portfolio, you will find a selection of some of the significant technical projects I have worked on in recent years. These projects demonstrate my ability to tackle complex engineering challenges while keeping sustainability and environmental considerations at the forefront. From designing and optimizing renewable energy systems to developing efficient waste management solutions, each project showcases my dedication to creating a positive impact through engineering.</p>
            <p>Thank you for taking the time to review my engineering portfolio. I hope that it illustrates my passion for engineering, my commitment to sustainability, and my aspiration to create a career that integrates the realms of space exploration and environmental sustainability.</p>
